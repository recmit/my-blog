    "## What is leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a machine learning model to make predictions is tricky (especially about the future!). One of the main issues is [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting): If left unchecked, models will tend to fit the training data too specifically in a way that doesn't actually generalize to \"future data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we always set aside a subset of the data (the **test set**) to evaluate the model predictions. The model never gets to see the test data during training, to simulate new data like the data the model will have to deal with when in real deployment. At first this seems like a foolproof method to gauge how well the model will do in practice, assuming that the \"future data\" in the context the model needs to operate arises from the same probability distribution as our current data (that is a whole other issue, see [data drift](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-monitor-datasets?tabs=python)).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practice there might be **unintended correlations** between the test set and the data we used to train the model (the **training set**). Those correlations might allow us to make predictions based on information which we wouldn't actually have access to at prediction time in reality. We call this phenomenon **data leakage**, because \"future\" information is accidentally leaking from the test set to the training set. This can lead to dramatically overestimating the true model performance. Even worse, the model could end up mostly relying on the leakage for predictions, to the detriment of legitimate signals. This would make it essentially useless in a real deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This somewhat abstract description will become clearer once we look at a specific instance of leakage."

    "## Where is the leakage?\n",
    "In the case of the famous **Titanic** [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) there is a major source of information leakage. **Groups of women and children** traveling together tend to either all live or all die, simply because they tended to stay together. Women and children were famously prioritized on the lifeboats, while adult men were separated from their families.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an instance of data leakage because we wouldn't have known which families were going to survive before the Titanic sank, yet it provides us with a lot of information on passenger survival in our data. Strictly speaking, it is open to debate what exactly constitutes leakage in a one-time event such as in the Titanic disaster. However, if we imagine having to make a prediction about another ship sinking in similar circumstances, it seems unreasonable to assume that we would have information on which families would survive *beyond the information on which passengers would survive*. In contrast to survival per passenger class, for instance, family survival is seems to be subject to random events in a way that is not generalizable (what could be called random noise)."

   "source": [
    "## Why does the leakage matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not the first one to point out that family survival is a major predictor of individual passenger survival. As far as I know, however, the extent and importance of the leakage has not been thoroughly investigated yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no doubt that using the leakage gives an important advantage in the Kaggle Titanic competition. Most passenger groups (which we will specify below) have in fact been separated in the train-test split. This is not a particular characteristic of the Kaggle test set. Instead, it is statistically a near-certainty given the number of groups and the group sizes, as long as the test set makes up a third of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can distinguish three ways in which the leakage has been used on the Kaggle competition over the years:\n",
    "- [Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/titanic-using-name-only-0-81818/notebook) and others have already observed that one can get very good results (better than many sophisticated approaches) just by making predictions with a very simple rule **using family survival directly** (but not explicitly identifying it as an example of data leakage, to the best of my knowledge). The rule is the following: Just predict that all males die and all females live, except for boys whose family survived (who are predicted to live instead) and females whose family died (who are predicted to die instead). We will implement this model bellow and compare its accuracy with other approaches.\n",
    "- People like [Erik Bruin](https://www.kaggle.com/code/erikbruin/titanic-2nd-degree-families-and-majority-voting/report) have also noticed that adding \"family survival\" as an **engineered feature** helps train models. This basically amounts to [target encoding](https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/target-encoding/) of an engineered \"family group feature\", where the groups are replaced by the mean survival of the group within the training set (or NA if the group is not represented in the training set).\n",
    "- Finally, beyond the explicit uses of the data leakage listed above, it is conceivable that many classifiers **use it implicitly and inadvertently**. Groups traveling together can be identified from features such as passenger class, port of embarkation, ticket number, cabin number, number of family members on board (children, parents, siblings, spouses). The 'Age' feature as well as the engineered \"title feature\" can be used to identify children.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to make clear that I am not suggesting any of the above constitutes cheating. It doesn't go against the rules of the competition (I believe) and, in any case, the Titanic competition is intended for people who are relatively new to machine learning (such as myself) to practice with an interesting problem and a manageable data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I think it is interesting to investigate how pervasive this leakage is. That is to say, how much do classifiers rely on this data leakage, whether explicitly or implicitly? And how well can we do without it?"

    "## How do we plug the leak?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a simple solution. We just need to create an alternative test set which, unlike the Kaggle test set, doesn't contain any *partial* passenger groups. In other words, groups are either fully in the test set or fully in the training set. We will call such a train-test split **leak-proof**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting slightly more sophisticated, we want to perform multiple train-test leak-proof splits. Taking the mean accuracy over multiple splits allows us to reduce the error in estimating the model performance. This process is called **cross-validation** (often abbreviated \"CV\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go into more detail bellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**: To do our custom train-test splits we need the full survival outcomes for *all* passengers. While this is publicly available data, I was reluctant to make it even easier to find it for people competing in the Kaggle competition. However, I think that on balance it is worth exploring the questions considered here, at the risk of potentially making the full data easier to access. Frankly, it seems that the cat is out of the bag, considering the large number of perfect scores on the leaderboard. In fact, the place where I found the full data is actually on Kaggle! There was an external link to the data surreptitiously hidden at the end of a long notebook, where it was quietly used to make a submission (with a perfect score, needless to say).\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid \"spoilers\" about the Kaggle test set, I will try to reveal as little specifics on the test set as possible. The overall survival rate does appear later on, but that can be figured out easily by submitting an \"everyone dies\" prediction."

    "## Here is what we will do\n",
    "\n",
    "We will address two questions:\n",
    "- If we prevent leakage using leak-proof train-test splits as mentioned above, how well can we predict passenger survival? More concretely, could we do better than a simple baseline if we can't use the leakage?\n",
    "- How do we estimate to which extent a specific classifier is \"secretly\" using the leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **first point**, we will create an \"exemplary\" classifier and evaluate it using a leak-proof cross-validation. We will compare its accuracy to that of some **simple baselines**, to see how well it does once the leakage has been prevented. For the classifier we will use the popular **XGBoost** classifier. To get the most out of the classifier, we will also perform **feature engineering** and **hyperparameter tuning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **second point** is actually hard to answer definitively. We will **compare the accuracy** of a classifier under a **leak-proof cross-validation** and a **\"leaky\" cross-validation** (i.e. a regular cross-validation in which the groups can be divided in the train-test split). If a classifier does worse under the former than under the latter, this suggests that the classifier was using the leakage. However, we need to be cautious about drawing conclusions just from that, because the leak-proof train-test splits might make it \"harder\" to generalize from the training set to the test set in more subtle ways. To dig a little deeper, we will compare the prediction accuracy on the **solo travelers**, i.e. passengers who are traveling alone (to the best of our knowledge).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outline:**\n",
    "- We will start by implementing the baseline classifiers and the XGBoost classifier.\n",
    "- Then, we will implement the cross-validation function, which will involve a nested cross-validation because of the hyperparameter search.\n",
    "- Finally, we will compute the accuracy of our classifier and of the baselines under various cross-validation schemes and discuss the results."

Intuitively, in a single train-test split we might get unlucky and have a particularly \"easy\" (or \"hard\") test set, which results in a misleading accuracy score. Taking multiple splits both mitigates this risk and actually allows us to estimate the error (by looking at the variation across splits).\n",

In contrast, we will refer to regular (group agnostic) cross-validation as **leaky cross-validation** because it enables leakage.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to identify the groups of passengers traveling together, who where likely to stay together during the sinking. This might require going beyond the closest family members (meaning those who have the same surname). One way to **find extended families** is to extract **maiden names**, which allows us to connect a married woman to her sister or mother, for instance. Even further, we can break apart **double surnames** (\"Kink-Heilmann\" or \"Penasco y Castellana\") to discover as many family relations as possible.\n",

This means that we want to catch as many real groups as possible, even at the cost of some **false positives**, while making sure the group sizes seem reasonable. To reduce the risk of false positives, we will only allow groups in which all passengers are traveling in the same class. This seems like a reasonable assumption for passengers sticking together.\n",

    "- If the surname of one passenger is the same as the surname, middle name, or any part of a double surname of another passenger, we put those passengers in the same group, *provided* they are in the **same passenger class**.\n",
    "- If the ticket numbers of two passengers agree, the passengers are in the same group. (Passenger with the same ticket number are automatically in the same passenger class.)\n",

In more mathematical language: the passengers are vertices in a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and the rules above determine when two **vertices** are connected by an **edge**. From this perspective, the passenger groups are the **connected components** of the graph. We will use the `networkx` library to find the passenger groups (connected components)."

That said, it would be interesting to explore the effects that changes in how the connections are formed have on the results below. There is the option of a much more targeted approach, where we painstakingly go over the groups and discover false connections by taking into account the 'Parch' (number of parents and children on board) and 'SibSp' (number of siblings and spouses on board) features and even by searching some information on the passengers online. Furthermore, we decided to compare the whole ticket numbers of passengers, but some people have pointed out that the last digits of the ticket numbers sometimes vary for families traveling together. When I tried to compare the tickets numbers ignoring the last digit, this seemed to lead to too large groups (likely many false positives).

    "To tune the hyperparameters we will use the `GridSearchCV` class from scikit-learn, which evaluates all hyperparameter combinations we provide (in the form of a \"parameter grid\") using cross-validation. The hyperparameters resulting in the highest mean accuracy are selected for the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating our classifier we **need to repeat the hyperparameter search for each split**, because the resulting hyperparameters depend on the training data to some extent. This means that the grid search cross-validation needs to be nested inside the main cross-validation, which we use to evaluate the model. For obvious reasons this is called a **nested cross-validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though scikit-learn has support for *group* cross-validation, we hit a roadblock with the **nested cross-validation**. To the best of my knowledge, it is currently not possible to pass the groups to the *inner* cross-validation within an *outer* cross-validation using the function `cross_validate`. However, if we tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost classifier using a leaky cross-validation and then evaluate the model accuracy using leak-proof cross-validation, we might underestimate the classifier's potential because the hyperparameters were specifically tuned for leaky train-test splits. To be able to have an *inner* leak-proof cross-validation will **need to write a custom cross-validation function** which can pass the groups through to the inner cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason we want a custom cross-validation function is to compute the **accuracy for** the **solo travelers** (in addition to the accuracy for all passengers). Solo travelers are those whose group has a size of \"1\". The hope is that looking at the accuracy on those passengers (which should be unaffected by the leakage) will help shed some light on whether a particular classifier is relying on the leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we implement the custom cross-validation function, which goes through the provided train-test splits (in the form of a `StratiedKFold` or `StratifiedGroupKFold` object), trains the classifier on each training set, computes the overall accuracy on each test set, and finally computes the accuracy on the solo travelers in each test set. When the classifier is a `GridSearchCV` object, the passenger groups are passed to it through its `fit` method. The function returns two NumPy arrays, one with the overall accuracy scores and one with the accuracy scores restricted to the solo travelers."

The standard errors of the mean accuracy scores are roughly given by dividing the standard deviation of the results of each cross-validation by $\\sqrt{5}$ (the square root of the number of folds). However, this would give us a somewhat downward biased estimate of the \"true\" standard error, given that the sample standard deviation is itself downward biased and the scores in a CV are not independent of each other (which is the underlying assumption for dividing by $\\sqrt{5}$). Estimating the standard error for k-fold cross-validation [is tricky](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/grandvalet04a/grandvalet04a.pdf).\n",

    "Overall, I think the results point toward real effects but it has to be said that the observed differences seem to be mostly between 1 and 2 standard errors (according to the rule of thumb). The next step would be a careful analysis of the errors. **Paired hypothesis tests** are necessary to compare classifiers evaluated with the same CV (take the accuracy differences for each split and compute the sample standard deviation of the differences).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind the caveats above, we saw that classifiers can perform better than the enhanced gender baseline, even if we prevent the group survival leakage. Recall that XGBoost had a mean accuracy $0.822$ versus the baseline $0.801$ when evaluated with the leak-proof CV (using leak-proof grid search CV). It would be very interesting to see how other classifiers do compared to the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the difference in accuracy is statistically significant, this indicates that there is more predictive information in the data than: 1) What is given by splitting the passengers using the 'Sex', 'Pclass', and 'Embarked' categories, and 2) The group survival leakage we identified. In fact, the $0.822$ mean accuracy achieved in the leak-proof CV is not far from the group survival baseline of $0.829$. This suggests that the amount of \"leakage-free\" information is comparable to the information we get from the leakage alone. The latter is highly speculative, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the table of mean accuracy scores seems to show that the XGBoost model is using the leakage when we use the \"truncated ticket\" feature, but doesn't really use the leakage if that feature is dropped. However, we need to be cautious with these conjectures, considering the higher standard deviation when dropping those features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let me know what you think! I welcome suggestions and I would be excited to see other people try this stuff out with other classifiers. There is still a lot to explore."

    "The Kaggle test set seems to be very typical, at least as far as the survival rate and passenger groups are concerned. In fact, both values (0.61 and 0.38) are close to the mean for both distributions (almost suspiciously close). This suggests that the test set was either drawn at random or specifically chosen to have a typical survival rate."
