To prevent the leakage we implement a leak-proof cross-validation. We compare the accuracy of an XGBoost classifier to various baselines to investigate which role, if any, the leakage is playing in the predictions of our classifier.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Latent Space of Podcasts</title><link href="david-recio.com/2022/03/19/podcasts-recommender.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Latent Space of Podcasts" /><published>2022-03-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-03-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>david-recio.com/2022/03/19/podcasts-recommender</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We train a podcast recommender using matrix-based collaborative filtering.

For this we implement hypothesis tests from three different paradigms: the permutation test, a semi-parametric bootstrap test, and ANOVA. As part of the analysis we compare the different tests through simulation.]]></summary></entry></feed>
