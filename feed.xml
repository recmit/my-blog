However, we didn't use the content of the reviews, which are an additional source of signal of user preference. Some of that signal can be extracted using sentiment analysis. In this post we will do so using two methods: VADER and BERT.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Training distilBERT to Predict Podcast Ratings</title><link href="david-recio.com/2022/10/21/bert-fine-tune-podcast-reviews.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Training distilBERT to Predict Podcast Ratings" /><published>2022-10-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>david-recio.com/2022/10/21/bert-fine-tune-podcast-reviews</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post we will use the Hugging Face API and PyTorch to fine-tune distilBERT on podcast reviews. We will train it to predict the rating from the title and body of the review. By converting ratings to sentiment, this also gives us a sentiment classifier. We will use Ray Tune for hyperparameter search and we will also evaluate the model in various ways.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Titanic has a Leak</title><link href="david-recio.com/2022/04/11/titanic-leak.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Titanic has a Leak" /><published>2022-04-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>david-recio.com/2022/04/11/titanic-leak</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We will explore a source of data leakage in the popular Titanic competition on Kaggle: Passengers traveling together have similar survival outcomes and this correlation can be used to make predictions for the test set in a way that wouldn't be possible in reality. To prevent the leakage we implement a leak-proof cross-validation. We compare the accuracy of an XGBoost classifier to various baselines to investigate which role, if any, the leakage is playing in the predictions of our classifier.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Latent Space of Podcasts</title><link href="david-recio.com/2022/03/19/podcasts-recommender.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Latent Space of Podcasts" /><published>2022-03-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-03-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>david-recio.com/2022/03/19/podcasts-recommender</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We train a podcast recommender using matrix-based collaborative filtering.
