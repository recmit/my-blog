Math PhD, self-taught in Python, stats, and machine learning while my Green Card application was pending. Most recently a postdoc at Lehigh University doing research on [Topological Robotics](https://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/AAT-readings/Robotics/Farber%20robotics%20survey.pdf).

Grew up in Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, studied math and physics in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, and did my PhD in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

Now a US permanent resident ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ based in Boston.

You can view my publications [here](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Recio-Mitter%2C+D). Note that I used my double surname Recio-Mitter on my articles. (In Spain everyone has a double surname but now that I am in the US I use my paternal surname to avoid confusion.)
